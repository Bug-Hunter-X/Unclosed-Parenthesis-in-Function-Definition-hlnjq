# Unclosed Parenthesis in Python Function Definition

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed error in Python: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition.  The error results in a `SyntaxError` during compilation.

The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.py` file provides the corrected version.

**How to reproduce:**
1. Run `bug.py` using a Python interpreter.  This will raise a `SyntaxError`.
2. Run `bugSolution.py`.  This will execute without error.

This simple example highlights the importance of careful code review and syntax checking to prevent common programming mistakes.
